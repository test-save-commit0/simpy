This module contains the basic event types used in SimPy.

The base class for all events is :class:`Event`. Though it can be directly
used, there are several specialized subclasses of it.

class Event:
    """An event that may happen at some point in time.

    An event

    - may happen (:attr:`triggered` is ``False``),
    - is going to happen (:attr:`triggered` is ``True``) or
    - has happened (:attr:`processed` is ``True``).

    Every event is bound to an environment *env* and is initially not
    triggered. Events are scheduled for processing by the environment after
    they are triggered by either :meth:`succeed`, :meth:`fail` or
    :meth:`trigger`. These methods also set the *ok* flag and the *value* of
    the event.

    An event has a list of :attr:`callbacks`. A callback can be any callable.
    Once an event gets processed, all callbacks will be invoked with the event
    as the single argument. Callbacks can check if the event was successful by
    examining *ok* and do further processing with the *value* it has produced.

    Failed events are never silently ignored and will raise an exception upon
    being processed. If a callback handles an exception, it must set
    :attr:`defused` to ``True`` to prevent this.

    This class also implements ``__and__()`` (``&``) and ``__or__()`` (``|``).
    If you concatenate two events using one of these operators,
    a :class:`Condition` event is generated that lets you wait for both or one
    of them.
